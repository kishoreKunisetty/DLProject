# Deep Learning Project
real time indian sign language recognition using pose detection

## Dataset

Created our own custom DataSet

## Tools Used 

+ mediapipe
+ streamlit
+ SciKit-Learn

## WorkFLow

Upon starting the streamlit app you need to check list start. It then starts videocapture and with the help of MediaPipe we get cordinates of 21 hand points which are then passed to randomForest Classifer to predict the sign we have made.
